# odin-recipes 
This file is to describe the current project, which is to create and build a 
basic recipe website with all the stuff we learned so far about HTML. 

This will test the HTML knowledge acquired so far in the course and will allow 
you to put it into practice. I expect to use a lot of HTML tags, especially the 
<a> tag, because their will be links to different parts of the website. I 
expect to become more familiar with HTML tags and learn new ones that I currently
do not know. I also expect to use and commit a lot to GIT, and become familiar 
with the commands that are used in/for GIT.

Reflection: I was able to apply and use all the tags that were taught in the lesson.
I managed to remember how to use the img src tag and how ../ would take me back to the previous folder/directory and eventually switch.go into the image folder to display the image.
During the project I forgot to add and push my files onto GitHub as I was making them. So first I need to learn how to do that, and second I have to do it while I am working on my project files.
